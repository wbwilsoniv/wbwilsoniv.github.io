    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I’m an adaptive problem solver with a passion for creating tools, experiences, and solutions to help people. Through my experience in hospitality, I’ve learned the importance of communication in order to effectively work with and lead a team to achieve a common goal. As an event sales manager, I worked with clients to bring their ideas to fruition throughout the full event lifecycle, making use of the resources available and creating my own tools when needed. By building upon my diverse experience, I’m able to view problems from different perspectives, and approach obstacles with an open mind, which serves me well in web development where there are many solutions, but it often takes collaboration to find the right one.</p>
